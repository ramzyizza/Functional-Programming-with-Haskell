## Text messaging
(From "Haskell Programming")
Remember old-fashioned phone inputs for writing text, where you had to press a button multiple times to get different letters to come up? You may still have to do this when you try to search for a movie to watch using your television remote control. Youâ€™re going to write code to translate sequences of button presses into strings and vice versa.

Here is the layout of the phone:
```
-----------------------------------------
| 1      | 2 ABC | 3 DEF  |
-----------------------------------------
| 4 GHI  | 5 JKL | 6 MNO  |
-----------------------------------------
| 7 PQRS | 8 TUV | 9 WXYZ |
-----------------------------------------
| *      | 0     | # .,   |
-----------------------------------------
```
The star (`*`) capitalizes the next letter (if you press it twice, then it reverts to lower case).  If there are multiple occurrences of `*` in a row, then it is the last one which will determine the capitalization.  `0` is your space bar. To represent the digit itself, you press that digit once more than the letters it represents. If you press a button one more than is required to type the digit, it wraps around to the first letter. For example:
```
2 -> 'a'
22 -> 'b'
222 -> 'c'
2222 -> '2'
22222 -> 'a'
0 -> ' '
00 -> '0'
000 -> ' '
1 -> '1'
11 -> '1'
111 -> '1'
```
You will not need to type '#', so
```
# -> '.'
## -> ','
### -> '.'
```
 Consider the following datatypes:
```haskell
-- Valid buttons are ['0'..'9']++['*','#']
type Button = Char
-- Valid presses are [1..]
type Presses = Int
-- Valid text consists of
-- ['A'..'Z']++['a'...'z']++['0'..'9']++['.',',',' ']
type Text = String
```
#### Exercise 1a.
Write a function
```haskell
phoneToString :: [(Button, Presses)] -> Text
phoneToString = undefined
```
that takes a list of buttons and the number of times to press them and gives back the corresponding text, e.g.
```hs
phoneToString [('*',1),('6',5),('5',4)] = "M5"
```
#### Exercise 1b.
Write a function
```haskell
stringToPhone :: Text -> [(Button, Presses)]
stringToPhone = undefined
```
taking a string to a list of buttons and the number of times that they need to be pressed, e.g.
```hs
stringToPhone "Hi, students." = [('*',1),('4',2),('4',3),('#',2),('0',1),('7',4),('8',1),('8',2),('3',1),('3',2),('6',2),('8',1),('7',4),('#',1)]
```
#### Exercise 1c.
Write a function
```haskell
fingerTaps :: Text -> Presses
fingerTaps = undefined
```
that computes the minimal number of button presses needed to input the given string, e.g.
```hs
fingerTaps "Hi, students." = 27
```
## Using Maybe Types
1. Rewrite the `head` and `tail` functions from the prelude so that  they use the `Maybe` type constructor to indicate when provided the argument was empty.
 ```haskell
 headMaybe :: [a] -> Maybe a
 headMaybe = undefined
 tailMaybe :: [a] -> Maybe [a]
 tailMaybe = undefined
 ```
1. Similarly, rewrite `take :: Int -> [a] -> [a]` to use `Maybe` to indicate
 when the index is longer than the list.
 ```haskell
 takeMaybe :: Int -> [a] -> Maybe [a]
 takeMaybe = undefined
 ```
1.  A common use of the `Either` type constructor is to return information
 about a possible error condition.  Rewrite the function `zip` from the
 prelude as
 ```haskell
 zipEither :: [a] -> [b] -> Either String [(a,b)]
 zipEither = undefined
 ```
 so that we only get the list of pairs when the two arguments have
 the same length.  If this is not the case, use the `String` to report
 which argument was smaller.
 
## Type Retractions
1. Recall the data type
 ```haskell
 data WeekDay = Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun
 deriving (Show, Read, Eq, Ord, Enum)
 ```
 defined in the Lecture Notes.  Define a new data type which represents just the **working days** of the week.  Show that it is a retract of the above type. You are expected to define the following type and write the following two functions:
 ```haskell
 data WorkingDay = ???
 toWeekDay :: WorkingDay -> WeekDay
 toWeekDay = undefined
 toWorkingDay :: WeekDay -> WorkingDay
 toWorkingDay = undefined
 ```
 
1.  Show that the type `Maybe a` is a retract of the type `[a]`.
 You are expected to write the following two functions:
 ```hs
 toList :: Maybe a -> [a]
 toList = undefined
 toMaybe :: [a] -> Maybe a
 toMaybe = undefined
 ```
