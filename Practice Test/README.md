## Question 1 ─ Parity [8 out of 40 marks]

### Background Material

We say that a byte (a sequence of 8 bits) has even parity if the number of `1`s
is even.

### Implementation Task

Write a function

```haskell
checkParity :: String -> Bool
checkParity = undefined
```

which takes as input a string of bits and checks that

1. the string size is a multiple of 8, and
1. each byte in the string has even parity.

The function should return `True` if both conditions are met, and `False`
otherwise.

We are representing bits here by the characters `0` and `1`.  You may
assume that the input strings contain only `0`s and `1`s.

### Examples

```hs
ghci> checkParity "01010101"
True
```
The above example has length 8 (a multiple of 8) and 4 ones (an even number).
```hs
ghci> checkParity "0111011101110110"
False
```
In the above example, the second byte has 5 ones.

```hs
ghci> checkParity "0101011"
False
```
The above example has only 7 bits (which is not a multiple of 8).

## Question 2 ─ Substitution [8 out of 40 marks]

### Background Material

A _substitution cipher_ is an old method of encryption, in which the cipher
takes a string and a _key_ that is as long as the alphabet that the message
uses. In our case, the message will be expressed using the English alphabet so
our cipher key will be a string of length 26. This represents a mapping of each
letter of the alphabet to a different letter.

For example, the key `"LYKBDOCAWITNVRHJXPUMZSGEQF"` maps `'A'` to `'L'`,
`'B'` to `'Y'`, `'C'` to `'K'` and so on.

### Implementation Task

Write a function

```haskell
substitution :: String -> String -> String
substitution plaintext key = undefined
```

which takes a plaintext string (that might contain punctuation and spaces) and
an uppercase key and returns the ciphertext.

**Note** the following:
* The capitalisation of the characters in the plaintext **must be preserved** by
  your implementation.
* The encryption should apply only to the letters (i.e. the alphabetic
  characters) and punctuation and spaces should be ignored. For this purpose,
  you can use the `isLetter :: Char -> Bool` function coming from `Data.Char` to
  test if a given character is a letter.
* You may wish to use the function
  ```
  charLabel :: Char -> Int
  charLabel char =  ord (toUpper char) - ord 'A'
  ```
  which converts a character to an index in the key.  This function can be found in
  `Types.hs` and will be imported for you automatically.

### Examples

```hs
key1 :: String
key1 = "LYKBDOCAWITNVRHJXPUMZSGEQF"

key2 :: String
key2 = "UDMZIQKLNJOSVETCYPBXAWRGHF"

plaintext1 :: String
plaintext1 = "The Quick Brown Fox Jumped Over The Lazy Dog"

plaintext2 :: String
plaintext2 = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

ghci> substitution plaintext1 key1
"Mad Xzwkt Yphgr Ohe Izvjdb Hsdp Mad Nlfq Bhc"

ghci> substitution plaintext1 key2
"Xli Yanmo Dptre Qtg Javciz Twip Xli Sufh Ztk"

ghci> substitution plaintext2 key1
"Nhpdv wjuzv bhnhp uwm lvdm, khrudkmdmzp lbwjwukwrc dnwm, udb bh dwzuvhb mdvjhp wrkwbwbzrm zm nlyhpd dm bhnhpd vlcrl lnwxzl.

```

Note: these examples are provided in `Types.hs` so you can run your function on
them to test that it works correctly on them.

## Question 3 ─ Primes [8 out of 40 marks]
### Background Material (Part 1 - [4 out of 8 marks])

A famous theorem about prime numbers (called _Chebyshev's Theorem_) asserts that
for any number `n`, there always exists a prime number `p` such that `n < p <
2n`. That is, there is always a prime number between `n` and `2n`.

#### Implementation Task

Write a function

```haskell
largestPrimeBetween :: Int -> Int
largestPrimeBetween = undefined
```

which returns the *largest* prime between `n` and `2n`.

#### Examples

```hs
ghci> largestPrimeBetween 4
7
ghci> largestPrimeBetween 10
19
```

### Background Material (Part 2 - [4 out of 8 marks])

In number theory, a **strong prime** is a prime number that is greater than the
average of the nearest prime above and below. In other words, it is closer to
the succeeding prime than it is to the preceding one.

For example, 17 is the seventh prime: the sixth and eighth primes, 13 and 19,
add up to 32, and half of that is 16; 17 is greater than 16, so 17 is a strong
prime.

#### Implementation Task

Write a function

```haskell
strongPrimes :: Int -> [Int]
strongPrimes n = undefined
```

which takes as input the integer `n` and prints the first `n` strong prime
numbers.

### Examples

```hs
ghci> strongPrimes 25
[11,17,29,37,41,59,67,71,79,97,101,107,127,137,149,163,179,191,197,223,227,239,251,269,277]
```

## Question 4 ─ Directions [8 out of 40 marks]

### Background Material

Consider the following encoding of directions using the type `Int`:
* `0` encodes a movement to the left
* `1` encodes a movement to the right
* `2` encodes a movement upwards
* `3` encodes a movement downwards
* other values of type `Int` encode no movement

For readability, we introduce the following type alias

```hs
type Direction = Int
```

Let us define the type `Command` to consist of a pair of a `Direction` and an
`Int`.

```hs
type Command = (Direction, Int)
```

Given a coordinate pair `(x, y)`, the _execution_ of a command consists in
incrementing the corresponding coordinate.

So for example, executing `(0, 10)` on the pair `(5, 5)` should result in
`(-5, 5)`. (We use the mathematical indexing: "right" means increasing the x
coordinate and "up" means increasing the y coordinate).

### Implementation Task

Write a function which, given an initial position `(x, y)`, computes the final
position after the execution of a list of commands.

```haskell
executeCommands :: [Command] -> (Int , Int) -> (Int , Int)
executeCommands = undefined
```

### Examples

```hs
ghci> executeCommands [(1,10),(0,5),(2,20)] (0,0)
(5,20)
```

## Question 5 ─ Babylonian Palindromes [8 out of 40 marks]

### Background Material

We say a number is a **palindrome** if it has at least two digits appears the same when its digits are reversed.  For example `14341` is a palindrome, while `145` is not.

The notion of being a palidrome, however, is not intrinsic to a number since it depends on which *base* we use to express it (the examples above are given in base 10).  For example, the number `21` is not a palindrome in base 10, while its representation in binary (i.e., base 2) is `10101` which *is* a palindrome.

Different cultures have used different bases for their number systems throughout history.  The Babylonians, for example, wrote numbers in base 60.

### Implementation Task

Write a function
```
babylonianPalindromes :: [Integer]
babylonianPalindromes = undefined
```
which produces the infinite list of Babylonian palindromes.
